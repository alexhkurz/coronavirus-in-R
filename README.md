# README

This is both a self-learning and a homeschooling project. I know Mathematics and Computer Science, but have never done data analysis or R before. Johanna is new to programming. 

Ideally, these notes will turn into a first  introduction to programming for high-school students with no previous experience. But I will assume that students can install programs, download files and open them in applications.

The motivation to learn about data anlysis now comes from the coronavirus crisis. One can read a lot of analyses. So why not making your own?

And it is more interesting to have a project right from the start, rather than to work through long tutorials and textbooks first. Each lesson below is a lesson we set ourselves. 

Of course, it is also good to follow a course. We chose Stefano de Sabbata's [GRANOLARR](https://sdesabbata.github.io/granolarr/), which is short for a geog**GR**aphic d**A**ta scie**N**ce, repr**O**ducib**L**e te**A**ching resou**R**ce in **R**. An awesome course. 

We'd love to get feedback and one way of doing this is, is to [raise an issue](https://github.com/alexhkurz/coronavirus-in-R/issues). Or send me an email. In particular, it would be  great to hear from parents and children who took up a similar project.

- [Lesson 1](lessons/lesson-01/lesson-01.md): Download coronavirus data and plot it.   

- [Lesson 2](lessons/lesson-02/lesson-02.md): How far does Germany lag behind Italy?

---

drafts:

- [Lesson](lessons/lesson-git/lesson.md): Managing projects in Rstudio

possible directions to take:

- Lesson: Compare two different countries. Functions in R.

- Data analysis: Compute the lag automatically, Visualise how the lag changes over time, Find reasons for changing lags, ...

- Data preprocessing: Extracting data from large tables, ...

- Programming: Variables, Functions, How to use git, Machine Learning, ...

- Maths: Metric spaces, similarlity measures, ...

- Once we learned enough we could take part in [Kaggle Challenges](https://www.kaggle.com/covid19)
