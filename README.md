# README

This is both a self-learning and a homeschooling project. I know Mathematics and Computer Science, but have never done data analysis or R before. Johanna is new to programming. 

Ideally, these notes will turn into a first  introduction to programming for high-school students with no previous experience. But I will assume that students can install programs, download files and open them in applications.

[Introduction](intro.md)

## Part I: Basics

The aim is to develop a program that can be used to match the curves of the deaths of two countries. If you want to see what it does right now, load [deaths.R](src/deaths.R) into R, run it, and produce some sample graphs. If you understand how the program works and you can modify it to produce your own plots there will be not much to learn in Part I.

**Data analysis:**

- [Lesson 1](lessons/lesson-01/lesson-01.md): Download coronavirus data and plot it.   

- [Lesson 2](lessons/lesson-02/lesson-02.md): How far does Germany lag behind Italy?

- [Lesson 3](lessons/lesson03/lesson-03.md): How far do other countries lag behind Italy? 

Examples of [reports](reports/reports.md) one can quickly generated with the program [deaths.R](src/deaths.R).


**Programming skills**: (unfinished drafts only)
- [Managing files.](lessons/lesson-files.md)
- [Variables and types](lessons/lesson-strings.Rmd). How to manipulate strings.
- [Filtering data](lessons/lesson-filter.Rmd). How to automatically extract information from data.
- [Managing projects with Git](lessons/lesson-git.md). How to use version control.

**possible future directions to take**:

- Lesson 4: Automating reports: Functions in R.

- Data analysis: Compute the lag automatically, Visualise how the lag changes over time, Find reasons for changing lags, ...

- Classify countries according to different growth rates. At the moment it looks as if almost all countries have the same growth rate, but, also, at the moment we always ever directly compare two countries.

- Data preprocessing: Extracting data from large tables, ...

- Programming: Variables, Functions, How to use git, Machine Learning, ...

- Maths: Metric spaces, similarlity measures, ...

- Once we learned enough we could take part in [Kaggle Challenges](https://www.kaggle.com/covid19)
