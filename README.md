# README

This is both a self-learning and a homeschooling project. I know Computer Science, but have never done data analysis or R before. Johanna is new to programming.

The motivation to do this now came from the coronavirus crisis. One can read a lot of analyses. So why not making your own?

And it is more fun to do sth interesting right from the start, rather than to work through long tutorials. So each lesson below is a lesson we set ourselves. 

Of course, it is also good to follow a course. We chose Stefano de Sabbata's [GRANOLARR](https://sdesabbata.github.io/granolarr/), which is short for a geog**GR**aphic d**A**ta scie**N**ce, repr**O**ducib**L**e te**A**ching resou**R**ce in **R**. An awesome course. 

We'd love to get feedback and one way of doing this is, is to [raise an issue](https://github.com/alexhkurz/coronavirus-in-R/issues) or send me an email. To raise an issue you need to sign in to github. 

- [Lesson 1](lessons/lesson-01/lesson-01.md): Download coronavirus data and plot the deaths of a country.   

- [Lesson 2](lessons/lesson-02/lesson-02.md): How far does Germany lag behind Italy?

---

possible directions to take:

- Lesson 3: Compare two different countries

- Data analysis: Compute the lag automatically, Visualise how the lag changes over time, ...

- Programming: Variables, Functions, How to use git, ...

- Maths: Metric spaces, similarlity measures, ...
