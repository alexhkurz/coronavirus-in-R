# Maths 1 - Measure Exponential Growth

There are (at least) three ways of measuring exponential growth.

- The transmission rate R counts how many people every person infects
  - If R>1 then we exponential growth.
  - If R<1 then we have exponential decay.

- The daily number of new cases:
  - If we have every day, say,  50 new cases (as currently in Orange County) then growth is linear.
  - If we have every day, say, 50% new cases then growth is exponential.

- The doubling time (DT):
  - If the number of cases doubles every three days (as is typical for the unmitigated coronavirus), we have exponential growth.

**Questions:** How do these three different ways of looking at exponential growth relate? What are the formulas that allow us to compute one from the other? What, exactly, is exponential growth in the first place?

We finished this class by studying the graph "Confirmed Cases Doubling Times"  at [Coronavirus Graphs](https://coronavirusgraphs.com/), comparing countries of interest such as the US, France, and Germany.

  - Lower values on the "y"-axis mean faster growth.
  - Why do different countries show the same drop of doubling times in late February?
  - Constant (average) doubling times (as nearly realised in the first half of March) mean exponential growth. 
  - What are the doubling times in the first half of March (choose your countries of interest)?
  - A rising curve of doubling times (as in April) means flattening the curve of cases.
  - Compare the doubling times of Germany, Sweden and Norway. Is a doubling time 16 days (Sweden, Apr 26) good enough or is a doubling time of 29 (Norway) better? 
  - Note that the last question has no objective answer but is a matter of debate and policy. 29 days means more stringent social distancing and a bigger impact on the economy while 16 days means fewer deaths.
