**Currency Data:** 
- Download from the European Central Bank the [historical reference rates](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.en.html) in csv format and plot in the same graph the exchange rates USD/GBP and EUR/GBP and EUR/USD from Jan 1, 2019 until today.
- Automate the process so that updating the calculation to the most recent data only requires to run the R-script again. In particular, it should not be necessary to download the most recent data "by hand", nor should it be necessary to modify the R-script in any way.
