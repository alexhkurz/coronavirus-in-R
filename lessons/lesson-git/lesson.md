# Setting up a working environment

(unfinished draft)

Remember that last time you had to save my files from git manually?

A better way is to learn a bit how git works. Git allows us to maintaint and synchronize different copies of the same **repository**.

We will follow the instructions on [Using Git with RStudio](https://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/ubc-r/session03_git.html).

Personally, I like to use the editor `visual studio code`, which also has a good integration with git. But for this project, I am planning to see how far we can get with staying inside Rstudio.
