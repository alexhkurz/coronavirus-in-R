# Comparing coronavirus deaths across different countries 

To draw your own plots, run [deaths.R](../src/deaths.R) in R.

If you are, like me, new to R, see the [README](../README.md) for details.

## Estimating the lag between countries

[March 29](report-2020-03-29.md)  
[March 23](report-2020-03-23.md)  

Some takeaways suggested by only looking at how the number of deaths have been developing:

- Spain looks to be affected worse than Italy
- Sweden is not going to be better off than Italy
- US, UK, Germany follow Italy with a lag between 2-3 weeks
- South Korea started out like Italy but is much better of
- Greece has slower growth than Italy (in the data)

Of couse, this is very rough. Much more has to be taken into account to fully understand what is happening.
