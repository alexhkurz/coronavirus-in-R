# Introduction


The motivation to learn about data anlysis now comes from the coronavirus crisis. One can read a lot of analyses. So why not making your own? 

A good example of what can be done with data analysis is this visualisation on [How To Tell If We're Beating COVID-19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc). By the way, one of my favourite visualisation is about the [history of the top chess players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2DHpW79w0Y).

And it is more interesting to have a project right from the start, rather than to work through long tutorials and textbooks first. Each lesson below is a lesson we set ourselves. 

Of course, it is also good to follow a course. We chose Stefano de Sabbata's [GRANOLARR](https://sdesabbata.github.io/granolarr/), which is short for a geog**GR**aphic d**A**ta scie**N**ce, repr**O**ducib**L**e te**A**ching resou**R**ce in **R**. An awesome course. 

We'd love to get feedback and one way of doing this is, is to [raise an issue](https://github.com/alexhkurz/coronavirus-in-R/issues). Or send me an email. In particular, it would be  great to hear from parents and children who took up a similar project.

## Organisation

It seems one can organise the material into two threads. 

- Each numbered lessons addresses a data analysis question. 
- The other lessons cover some necessary computer and programming related background and can be skipped by those who already have some experience in these matters.

I also like to call these two threads the interesting one and the boring-but-necessary one. (Of course, nerds like myself may find the boring-but-necessary interesting in its own right.) 

My teaching experience suggests that students and teachers get frustrated by the boring-but-necessary parts. This can create a vicious circle in which teachers spend more and more time on trying to improve the teaching of the boring-but-necessary parts, thereby making the course ever more boring. This is another reason to distinguish the two parts separate.
