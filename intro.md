# Introduction


The motivation to learn about data anlysis now comes from the coronavirus crisis. One can read a lot of analyses. So why not making your own? 

A good example of what can be done with data analysis is this visualisation on [How To Tell If We're Beating COVID-19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc). But also simple graphs can be interesting, see eg [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/opinion/coronavirus-cases-united-states.html) and [here](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-united-states-europe.html).

And it is more interesting to have a project right from the start, rather than to work through long tutorials and textbooks first. Each lesson below is a lesson we set ourselves. 

Of course, it is also good to follow a course. We chose Stefano de Sabbata's [GRANOLARR](https://sdesabbata.github.io/granolarr/), which is short for a geog**GR**aphic d**A**ta scie**N**ce, repr**O**ducib**L**e te**A**ching resou**R**ce in **R**. An awesome course. 

An excellent book is [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html). Like this course this book is aimed at beginners, but it is also a well-rounded textbook written by actual experts.

We'd love to get feedback and one way of doing this is, is to [raise an issue](https://github.com/alexhkurz/coronavirus-in-R/issues). Or send me an email. In particular, it would be  great to hear from parents and children who took up a similar project.

## Organisation

It seems one can organise the material into two threads. 

- Each numbered lessons addresses a data analysis question. 
- The other lessons cover some necessary computer and programming related background and can be skipped by those who already have some experience in these matters.

I also like to call these two threads the interesting one and the boring-but-necessary one. (Of course, nerds like myself may find the boring-but-necessary interesting in its own right.) 

My teaching experience suggests that students and teachers get frustrated by the boring-but-necessary parts. This can create a vicious circle in which teachers spend more and more time on trying to improve the teaching of the boring-but-necessary parts, thereby making the course ever more boring. This is another reason to distinguish the two parts separate. 

## References

I collect here references that are not central to the technical part of the course but have been influential nevertheless. Technical references appear during the text. 

[The Meaning of A Liberal Education](https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.76681/page/n3/mode/2up) from 1926 by [Everett Dean Martin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Dean_Martin) starts with the question whether we learn to aquire knowledge or whether learning is "an adventure in any kind of truth seeking which changes the quality of one's future experience and enables one to behave not merely efficiently but wisely, with a broad view and a sympathetic understanding of the many ways in which men have striven to create meaning and value out of the possibilities of human life" (page 27). Certainly, learning R was an adventure I was seeking for the experience as much as for the knowledge. The awareness that the coronavirus will change the world and how we behave makes it important to seek new ways of creating meaning and value. Certainly, a better understanding of reading and processing data will be an important part of any search for truth. 

One of my favourite visualisation is about the [history of the top chess players](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2DHpW79w0Y).
